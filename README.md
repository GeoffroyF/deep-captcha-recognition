# deep-captcha-recognition
Deep learning algorithms to recognize the characters on a captcha

# Project
This was a project done while following the Big Data Master's deep-learning course at Novosibirsk State University (RU)

# Technology
This project was realized using `Fatstai (pytorch)` 

# Solutions
Two solutions are presented:

* A resnet18 model featuring a Cross-Entropy loss function
* A resnet18 model featuring a CTC loss function
 
# Dataset
I used png images from a kaggle dataset

`https://www.kaggle.com/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images`

# Data access when executing the code
* Before executing the code you will need to add the images from kaggle to your own google drive.

* Modify the paths in the notebooks to access the data.
